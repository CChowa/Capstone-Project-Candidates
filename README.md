1.	Allstate Claims Severity: When a devastating insured event happens, clients would appreciate a worry-free claims experience where they don’t have to push paper with their insurance agent. Allstate is looking for an automated method of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. 

Since the data has a response variable (the cost), this is a supervised problem where the algorithm will be trained to find patterns among the feature data (inputs) that will produce the closest solution to the desired response (output). That is, we find the model that minimizes the mean absolute error between the predicted response and the actual response values.  

Furthermore, since the response variable is quantitative and continuous, a regression type analysis would be preferable rather than classification. This is because we are calculating a value for each object and not placing the object in a class or category.

2.	Insurance Company Benchmark: Using data supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research, the goal of this project is to predict whether a customer from a particular zip-code will carry a caravan insurance policy. 

This problem can be classified as a supervised problem because it has a response variable that can be used to train or supervise the analysis. The response variable is whether the customer carries a caravan policy (yes) or not (no).

Each customer’s information is used in combination to place the customer in one of two classes. This is a classification problem. The response variable is qualitative in nature, hence the goal is to predict the probability of each customer belonging to one or the other category.

3.	Bank Marketing: This data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

The existence of a response variable makes this problem a supervised problem. We are able to train the algorithm using a set of data for which we have values of the response variable. Furthermore, since the response variable is qualitative and binary (subscribe/not subscribe), we can conclude that this is a classification problem.
